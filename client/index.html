			<p>Jordan: Overall, I like the project. Nice work guys!</p>
			<p>Jared: I think some features need work. The posts should be editable once posted.</p>
			<p>Brian: This project is trash, you should just throw it away.</p>
			<p>Jordan: Hey man, that is not constructive feedback, I am flagging your comment to be removed.</p>
			<p>Jared: I agree with Jordan. This kind of feedback does not help the project presenters in any way. You should really try to provide some more helpful advice.</p>
			<p>Brian: Oh I didn't realize how harsh I was being. I'm sorry. I will remove my message.</p>
			<p>Brian: I think I meant to say I was not that impressed with this project, and it needs more work.</p>
			<p>Jordan: That is some positive feedback, Brian.</p>
